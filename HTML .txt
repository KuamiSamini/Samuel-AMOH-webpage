        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Samuel A. AMOH. I had my basic education in Akyem Gyadam and later continued at Oda Nkawanta Methodist Junior High School. After completing my junior high school education in 2015, I gained admission to study General Science at Oda Senior High School.
            In 2020, I was admitted to study BSc Industrial Engineering at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. Later, I received a scholarship to study abroad in Canada, where I am currently pursuing Computer Aided Design (CAD) Technician.
